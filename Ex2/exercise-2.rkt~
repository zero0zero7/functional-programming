; · Not / And

; Not: take a unary predicate and produce its negation.
; And: take two unary predicates and produce their conjunction.

; · tag

; Take a value v and produce a unary predicate that determines whether
; its argument is a non-empty list starting with v.

; The body implementation is partially completed. Complete it by using the
; given expression but without mentioning the parameter t again — this is
; known as “point-free” programming (the parameter is consider the “point”).
; The earlier functions you defined support point-free programming: use those.

(define (tag t)
  (compose (λ (v) (equal? t v)) first))


; · A Point Class

; The Point function behaves as the single constructor for a “class”.
; Calling it produces an “instance/object” of the class.
;
; Instance variables are not directly accessible.
;
; Instance methods are invoked by calling an instance with a symbol for the
; name of the method (in early OO this was referred to as sending a message).
; Although one can define variadic functions in racket, we will use a
; fundamental emulation technique from the Lambda Calculus: if a method
; needs an argument then it returns a function that can be called with
; the remaining arguments (this is a form of “currying”). Study the test
; cases to determine which methods produce such a function, what the arity
; of that function is, and what datatype that function produces.

; Implement Point.

; Do not use if, cond, nor equal?. Instead, use match with literal patterns:
(check-equal? (match 'hi
                ('hello "hello friend")
                ('hi "yo"))
              "yo")
#;
(module+ test
  (define p (Point 3 4))
  (check-equal? (p 'x) 3)
  (check-equal? (p 'y) 4)
  (check-equal? (p 'size) (sqrt (+ (sqr 3) (sqr 4))))
  (check-equal? (((p 'scale) 5) 'x) (* 3 5))
  (check-equal? (((p 'scale) 5) 'size) 25)
  (check-equal? (((p 'add) (Point 2 8)) 'y) 12)
  (check-equal? (((p 'add) (Point 2 8)) 'size) 13))

(define (Point x y)
  (λ (msg)
    msg))

; · tails

; Consider a subset of racket with the following grammar:
;   expression :=   literal
;                 | identifier
;                 | (and expression ... consequent-expression)
;                 | (if condition-expression
;                       consequent-expression
;                       alternative-expression)
;                 | (function-expression argument-expression ...)
; Recall that "..." is Kleene-* (meaning ”zero or more of the previous”).

; A sub-expression e′ of an expression e is “in tail position with respect to e”
; iff: if e′ (which could be e) is evaluated during the evaluation of e then
; the value of e′ is used as the value of e.

; So, a literal or identifier is in tail position wrt itself (and contains
; no sub-expressions).
; A function call is in tail position wrt itself, and contains no other
; sub-expressions that are in tail position wrt it.
; For (and expression ... consequent-expression), the sub-expressions in
; tail position wrt it are the sub-expressions of consequent-expression that
; are in tail position wrt consequent-expression.
; For (if condition-expression consequent-expression alternative-expression)
; the sub-expressions in tail position wrt to it are the sub-expressions in
; consequent-expression that are in tail position wrt consequent-expression,
; and the sub-expressions in alternative-expression that are in tail position
; wrt alternative-expression.

; Implement tais, which takes a racket value representing an expression
; matching the grammar, and produces a list of the sub-expressions in
; tail position wrt it.

; Literals are represented by their corresponding racket values,
; identifiers by symbols, and parenthesized expressions by lists.

; A straightforward implementation is smaller than the prose description
; (which you should recognize as a structurally recursive definition of
; a set and a function on that set).

; Do not use if, cond, nor equal?. Instead, use match with “list” patterns:
(check-equal? (match '(hi there buddy)
                ((list x y 'buddy) (list x y))
                ((list x ... y) (list x y))
                (whatever whatever))
              '(hi there))
(check-equal? (match '(hello there my friend)
                ((list x y 'buddy) (list x y))
                ((list x ... y) (list x y))
                (whatever whatever))
              '((hello there my) friend))
(check-equal? (match "yo dawg"
                ((list x y 'buddy) (list x y))
                ((list x ... y) (list x y))
                (whatever whatever))
              "yo dawg")
